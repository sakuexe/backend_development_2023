"""
    Assignment 2 - URL fetcher and parsing HTML for "dangerous" words
    ---
    Requirements:
    - Test if byte data from URL is UTF-8 decodable.
    If not, ask for a destination and save the file normally
    - Check the URLs' text data for any of the following dangerous words:
    [
        bomb, kill, terror,
        terrorist, terrorists, terrorism
    ]
    - The words above need to be separate.
    (So no matches for words like bomba, killer or antiterrorism)
    - The words need to be case insensitive
    - save the contents of the file onto a local file
    - Give an error message and stop (and not crash) the program
    - Ask the user for the path of which to save the file into
    ---
    Use the command "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
    to install all the needed pip packages for these assignments
